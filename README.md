FedEx Logistics Performance and Cost Optimization EDA
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on FedEx logistics shipment data to identify delivery delays, cost drivers, vendor performance issues, and regional bottlenecks. The analysis aims to provide actionable business insights to optimize logistics operations and improve customer satisfaction.

🎯 Business Objective

To improve delivery performance and reduce logistics cost by analyzing shipment modes, vendor INCO terms, country-wise delays, freight cost behavior, and insurance patterns.

🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset contains end-to-end logistics lifecycle information such as:

Shipment identification (PO, ASN/DN, project code)

Geography & management details

Shipment modes & INCO terms

Product, weight, quantity, and pricing details

Delivery timeline and cost metrics

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Plotly (optional interactive charts)

🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Data cleaning & feature engineering

Delivery delay calculation & classification

Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis (UBM rule)

20+ meaningful charts including heatmaps, pair plots, scatter plots, and boxplots

Correlation analysis & anomaly detection

📈 Key Insights

Air shipments dominate but increase freight cost.

Ocean shipments show higher delivery delays.

Congo DRC and Togo are major delay-prone countries.

INCO terms such as EXW significantly increase logistics responsibility.

Shipment weight and line item value strongly influence freight and insurance cost.

📌 Recommendations

Optimize shipment mode usage.

Improve operations in high-delay regions.

Re-evaluate vendor INCO term strategy.

Monitor high-cost outlier shipments.

Improve data quality to avoid incorrect business decisions.

🏁 Conclusion

This project provides a strong analytical foundation for logistics optimization and helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and profitability.
