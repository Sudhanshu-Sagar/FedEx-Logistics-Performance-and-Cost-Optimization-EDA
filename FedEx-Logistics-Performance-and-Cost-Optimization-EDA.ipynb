        "This project focuses on analyzing FedEx logistics shipment data to understand the key factors affecting delivery performance, freight cost, and overall operational efficiency. FedEx operates a complex global supply chain, where shipments are handled by different teams, transported using multiple modes, and governed by various vendor agreements known as INCO terms. Any inefficiency in this process can result in delivery delays, increased costs, and reduced customer satisfaction. The goal of this project is to use data analysis to identify such inefficiencies and provide actionable insights to improve logistics operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset contains detailed information about the entire shipment lifecycle, including project codes, purchase orders, shipment modes, vendor INCO terms, product descriptions, shipment weight, freight cost, insurance cost, and key delivery dates. To make the dataset analysis-ready, extensive data cleaning and wrangling were performed. Column names were standardized, missing values were handled appropriately, incorrect data types were fixed, and date fields were converted into proper datetime formats. A critical feature called “delivery_delay_days” was engineered by calculating the difference between scheduled and actual delivery dates. Another derived column, “delivery_status,” was created to classify shipments as either on-time/early or delayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis was conducted using the UBM framework, which includes Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis. In the univariate stage, shipment mode usage, delivery status distribution, and vendor INCO term frequency were studied. It was found that air shipments dominate the logistics process, followed by truck shipments, while ocean and air charter are used much less frequently. The majority of shipments are delivered on time, but a significant number are still delayed, which highlights the need for improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bivariate analysis was used to understand the relationships between variables. It was observed that ocean shipments have the highest average delivery delay, while air and truck shipments are generally delivered on time or early. Country-wise analysis revealed that regions such as Congo DRC, Togo, and Benin experience higher delivery delays compared to other countries. Freight cost was found to increase with shipment weight, and insurance cost increased significantly with higher line item values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multivariate analysis further deepened the understanding by analyzing multiple factors together. Heatmaps showed that certain combinations of shipment mode and INCO terms, such as Ocean with DDP, result in higher delays. Correlation analysis revealed a very strong relationship between line item value and insurance cost, as well as between line item quantity and line item value. However, delivery delay did not show strong correlation with numerical features, indicating that delays are mainly influenced by operational and regional factors rather than shipment size or value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project highlights several important business insights. The heavy dependence on air transport increases logistics cost, while ocean shipments contribute to higher delays. INCO terms like EXW shift cost and risk responsibility to FedEx, increasing freight expenses. Data quality issues such as “Unknown” shipment modes also impact accurate analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the findings, it is recommended that FedEx optimize shipment mode usage, focus on improving performance in high-delay regions, re-evaluate vendor INCO term strategies, and closely monitor high-cost shipments. By implementing these recommendations, FedEx can reduce delivery delays, control freight and insurance costs, and improve customer satisfaction."
